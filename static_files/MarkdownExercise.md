# A Day in My Coding Life

> *"Code. Coffee. Repeat."*

## What I usually do

- **Wake up** and grab a coffee â˜•  
- *Open* my laptop  
- Check `emails` and start coding  
- **Take a walk** after lunch  
- Watch a *YouTube* video or read something fun

## A simple Python snippet I wrote today:

```python
for i in range(5):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        print(f"{i} is even")
    else:
        print(f"{i} is odd")
```

## Some thoughts on math

Inline math like $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ is neat.

And here's a block equation:

$$
\varphi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}} e^{-x^2/2} \tag{1}
$$

Sometimes I notice patterns like:

$$ \begin{aligned}
a_n &\asymp b_n \\
&\sim c_n
\end{aligned} $$
