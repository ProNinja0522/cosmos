In today's and tomorrow's lab sessions, we will preview six project datasets out of eight in total. After this preview, each group will be assigned their dataset along with the starter Jupyer notebook that are used in preview session.

Today, we will go over **LSApp**, **NYC Citybike**, and **Wildfire** datasets. Since you don’t have access to the datasets yet, we’re providing HTML versions of the starter files for reference. Note that `plotly` figures are not shown in these files.
