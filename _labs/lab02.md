# Goal

In today's Lab session, we will:

- Learn Markdown Syntax
- Create a test repository and understand how it works.
- Create a group website.

# I. Markdown Syntax

# II. Test Repository
- Create `test` directory anywhere on your computer (e.g.,Desktop).
- Open **VS code** and click `File-Open folder`, then choose the `test` folder.
- Download **Github Pull Request** extension from the left sidebar.
- Create a file named `README.md` in `test` folder.
- Type anything you want.
- Save it: `Cmd+S` (Mac) or `Ctrl+S` (Windows).
- Click the source-control icon on the left sidebar.
- Click `Initialize repository`. This creates a hidden folder `.git` in your `test` directory.
- Stage and Commit.
- Click `Publish branch` and follow the instructions.
- Try push, pull, create branch, and pull request.
- After enough exercises, you may delete this repository from both Github and your local computer.

**File status markers**

- **U**: Untracked (new file not yet added to the repository)
- **A**: Added (new file added to the repository)
- **M**: Modified
- **R**: Renamed
- **D**: Deleted

During the course, you will maintain at least two collaborative repositories:

1. Group project.
2. Group website.


# Tomorrow

In tomorrow's lab session, we will learn Python Basics focusing on pandas and matplotlib.
